# Travail Personnel d'Initiative Encadr√©e
My 2 years undergraduate intensive classes of maths, physics and Computer Science's final project. 

This project's aim was to evaluate the trajectory of a golf's ball in order to guide the player when shooting.
It revolves around Computer Science (Object Tracking in Python using OpenCV) and physics (determining the trajectory of an moving object in an area).
